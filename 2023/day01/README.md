# Day 1

First time coding in Go so this was pretty rough lmao

## Part 1

One thing I overlooked was that you need to get ***ONLY*** the first and last digit of a line, in the example:

**a1b2c3d4e5f** = **15**

And when there is only a single digit in a line you need to repeat it to form the two-digit number, in the example:

**treb7uchet** = **77**

## Part 2

Almost finished but I really don't know how to check for both digits and spelled out digits in the same loop D:
